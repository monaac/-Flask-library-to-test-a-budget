# -Flask-library-to-test-a-budget
API code in Python using the Flask library to test a budget

This code sets a budget of 1000 and creates an endpoint /check_budget that accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing an "expense" key. If the expense is less than or equal to the budget, a success message is returned. If the expense is greater than the budget, a failure message is returned.
